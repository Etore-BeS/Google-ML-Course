# 🚀 Machine Learning Engineering Study Plan 🚀

Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning Engineering Study Plan! Here, you'll find all my exercises, projects, and notes as I dive deeper into the world of Machine Learning Engineering. 🎉

## 📚 About the Study Plan

This study plan is based on Google's Machine Learning book and current industry best practices. It's designed to help build experience and a portfolio suitable for pursuing ML Engineering jobs. The plan covers a wide range of topics from foundational concepts to advanced applications, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.

## 🎯 Purpose

I'm undertaking this study plan to enhance my skills in Machine Learning Engineering. By sharing my progress and exercises here, I aim to document my learning journey and potentially help others who are on a similar path. 🌟

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here's how this repository is organized:

- **week1/**: Foundations of ML and Python for ML
  - `day1/`: Framing ML Problems
    - `framing_case.md`: Detailed framing of a business problem for a telecommunications company.
    - `README.md`: Explanation of the day's activities and the contents of the `framing_case.md` file.
  - Additional days for Week 1 with relevant exercises and documentation.
- **week2/**: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
  - Daily exercises and projects.
- **week3/**: Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation
  - Daily exercises and projects.
- **week4/**: Advanced Topics and Final Portfolio Project
